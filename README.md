# dependencies sets - append multiple dependencies at once

If you want to quickly append dependencies to your `Python` project, just run in your terminal:

```bash
curl https://dpbm.github.io/depencies-sets/sets/THE_SET_YOU_WANT >> requirements.txt
```

## Available Sets
* [web](./sets/web)
* [security](./sets/security)
* [data](./sets/data)
* [math](./sets/math)

## help is welcome

If you want to help me, create a pull request with new sets or append more dependencies for available ones. 
You can also create an issue to ensure that your modification is good to the project.

Thanks for being interested :)
